# EDGE-powered-XAI-based-Crop-recommendation-system
This project is a machine learning-based solution that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and climate conditions. It uses a dataset containing features such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, with the target variable being the crop label.
